**Aim Genetics Lab** is a high-precision tool designed to analyze the psychophysiological foundation of an FPS player. Unlike standard aim trainers, this laboratory measures your "biological baseline": neural response speed, cognitive noise, and nervous system stability.

## 🔬 What does the Lab analyze?

The test is divided into 5 critical phases for a complete assessment of an aimer's potential:

1.  **Raw Reflex:** Measures the raw electrical signal speed from your eyes to your finger muscles.
2.  **Cognitive Processing:** The time your brain takes to identify a target (Friend vs. Foe) under pressure.
3.  **Sensorimotor Rhythm (Jitter):** Analyzes biological "noise" and micro-motor stability.
4.  **Peripheral Awareness:** Your ability to detect and process threats outside your main focus area.
5.  **Dynamic Intercept:** Testing your brain's ability to predict trajectories and click timings.
